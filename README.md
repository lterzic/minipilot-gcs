# Minipilot Ground Control Station

## Setup
Make sure that `docker` and `docker compose` are both installed. To start all the containers run the following:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
> Note: `-d` runs the containers in detached mode.

To verify that all containers are up and running, use `docker ps`.
